# BaseLingo

## Problem Statement

Traditional language learning apps suffer from high drop-off rates (e.g., 80% for Duolingo) and declining user engagement, despite gamification and accountability mechanisms.

## BaseLingo Solution

A decentralized application where users "stake, learn, and earn." Users deposit tokens, complete daily learning tasks, earn rewards, and can then withdraw their initial deposit plus earnings.

## Mechanism ("How it works")

*   Users deposit tokens into the app, which are put into a lending protocol (e.g., Morco) to earn yield.
*   They complete daily language learning assignments.
*   Upon completion, proof is posted to Farcaster, which authorizes the task completion.
*   Users then receive their initial deposit back, along with the earned yield as a reward.
*   The app incorporates gamification features and AI-powered feedback.
*   Funds are protected by secure vaults.

## Business Model

BaseLingo does not charge users directly. Instead, it profits from users who fail to complete their tasks and thus forfeit their staked tokens. These forfeited stakes are then re-staked on platforms like Morco to generate additional yield, allowing BaseLingo to offer premium features for free and reward active learners.

## Demonstration (MVP)

*   A minimalist viable product (MVP) was showcased.
*   Users connect their wallet, deposit a stake (e.g., 10 euros).
*   They complete a daily task (e.g., filling in a blank with the correct article).
*   Proof of learning is posted as a statement to Farcaster (e.g., "today I learned how to use the article for Barnhoff").
*   The lesson is marked complete, and the user earns yield (e.g., 3% for a 10 euro stake results in 10.3 euros).
*   Users can then withdraw their initial stake plus the earned yield.

## Advanced Features & Future Potential

*   Progress is tracked and verified by an LLM agent analyzing Farcaster posts, offering more robust feedback mechanisms than pre-programmed workflows.
*   The concept can be extended beyond language learning to other incentive-driven tasks, such as to-do lists.

## Employer Incentive Model

Employers can stake tokens for their employees to learn a new language. If the employee completes the course, they receive a portion of the stake/rewards; if not, the employer loses the stake, creating a "win-win-win" scenario for BaseLingo, employees, and employers.

## Q&A - Role of LLMs

LLMs can provide personalized feedback, guide learning paths, suggest next steps based on user progress and learned history, and identify areas needing more attention, making individual learning more effective. While core learning materials still need to be created, the LLM infrastructure enhances the learning experience. The presenter noted that BaseLingo could even integrate with existing learning providers, focusing on the incentive layer.
